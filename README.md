# rtt_rsi

Orocos component for control of KUKA robots using RSI. 

The code is based on the ROS control hardware interface in the ROS-Industrial `kuka_experimental` package found [here](https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental/tree/indigo-devel/kuka_rsi_hw_interface).

Note that this is a work in progress and breaking changes will occur.

See `./scripts/run.lua` for basic usage. This can be called with `rttlua -i run.lua`.
